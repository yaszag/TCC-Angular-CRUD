# TCC-Angular-CRUD-Application
A small Angular Application to manage persons.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yaszag/TCC-Angular-CRUD
cd TCC-Angular-CRUD
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
ng serve
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

### Run Json Server


```shell
npm run json:server
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

Enjoy !
